How to use this repo

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. In order to make it work, first you need to have a package manager installed, such as npm in Node.js or Yarn. Then you'll need to install create-react-app globally:

$ npm install -g create-react-app

or

$ yarn install -g create-react-app

Now you can:

1) Clone the repo.
2) Install the dependencies by running $ npm install / $ yarn install.
3) In the project directory, type $ npm start / $ yarn start to run the app in the development mode.
4) Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
5) Start coding! :)
