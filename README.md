How to use this repo

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. In order to make it work, first you need to have a package manager installed, such as npm in Node.js or Yarn. Then you'll need to install create-react-app globally:

$ npm install -g create-react-app

or

$ yarn install -g create-react-app

Now you can:

1) Clone the repo using 
$ git clone https://github.com/katia1802/brastlewark-population.git
2) Open your terminal
3) Install the dependencies by running $ npm install / $ yarn install.
5) $ npm audit fix 
6) Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser using $npm start.
7) Start searching for your gnome! :)
